Purchase Power

Purchase Power is a way for APPAREL STORE to give its customers discounted pricing on

specially offered apparel during certain times throughout the year.

 

During a Purchase Power program, orders are taken through a deadline date. After the deadline

has passed, we compile all orders and produce only enough garments to fill the orders received.

Once printing is complete, orders are picked and shipped, shipping on or before the guaranteed

“ship by” date.

 

Due to ordering deadlines and guaranteed “ship by” dates, orders for Purchase Power

merchandise CANNOT be combined with each other, regular catalog items or

discontinued/closeout items.

Running Purchase Power

Running Purchase Power is a way for APPAREL STORE to give its customers great pricing on

lots of different colors and styles of apparel but with low to no overhead cost that lead to higher

prices.

Running Purchase Power orders are collected every 1st and 3rd Thursday of the month and are

shipped 3 weeks later.  We compile all orders and produce only enough garments to fill the

orders received. Once production is complete, orders are picked and shipped, shipping on or

before the estimated ship date.

Due to ordering deadlines and extended ship by dates, orders for Running Purchase Power

merchandise CANNOT be combined with regular catalog items, regular Purchase Power items

or discontinued/closeout items.

We accept Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express credit cards, as well as purchase

orders for online payment. For customized orders, credit applications or assistance with

ordering, please call Customer Service toll-free at 877-742-5686.

 

***Please note that funds will be authorized from your credit card when you place an order, but

funds will not actually be captured until your order is shipped.***

 

Checks and Money Orders are accepted with an order form. Order forms are available in the

catalog or you can call Customer Service and they will provide one to you.

 

Sales Tax

We will charge sales tax for orders that are delivered to Wisconsin. Unfortunately at this time,

our system cannot accommodate online tax exempt orders. If you live in Wisconsin and are tax

exempt, please contact Customer Service at 877-742-5686 to place your order. A tax exemption
